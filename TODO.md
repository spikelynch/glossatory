Currently on the webfaction server, the existing RNN bots are using the master version of glossatory which doesn't rely on rnnbot.py.

The only bot using the new cleaner structure is gravidum_cor, the Anatomy of Melancholy bot.

At some stage, the other RNN bots need to be ported:

* glossatory
* oulipo_excavate
* oulipo_live
* vulgar

Note that glossatory, oulipo_live and vulgar all used the same codebase, the old version of glossatory
